# non_linear_graph_coarsening
introducing non-linearity in the graph coarsening process.
Added ReLU activation function in the coarsening process and made the required changes in the update parameters to incorporate this. Used graph convolution network (GCN) to train a model on this coarsened graph and checked its accuracy on various datasets. Selected the best hyperparameter values for the coarsening process based on the accuracies of the model.
